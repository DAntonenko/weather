An application for the openweathermap.org API (https://openweathermap.org/api) with a simple minimalist design. It allows you to view the current weather conditions, forecast, and air quality. There is a small Node.js backend for making API requests, so that private keys are not stored in the frontend. Can be installed as a PWA (Progressive Web App).
